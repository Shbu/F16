A light weight windows based VB script solution to keep your computer awake. Very useful if you need to sneak out during office hours whilst keeping your machine awake :D :P

## Steps
* All you have to do is download the .vbs file.
* Execute it on your windows machine.
* To verify, hit `ctrl` + `shift` + `esc` and go to the `details` under `Task Manager` and scroll down to look for `wsript.exe`.  If you see it, it means it's working.
