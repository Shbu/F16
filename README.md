# F16
A light weight windows based VB script solution to keep your computer awake. Very useful if you need to sneak out during office hours whilst keeping your machine awake :D :P

## Steps
* All you have to do is download the .vbs file.
* Execute it on your windows machine.
* To verify, hit `ctrl` + `shift` + `esc` and go to the `details` under the `Task Manager` and scroll down to look for `wsript.exe`.  If you see it, it means it's working :)
* If need to kill the process, just kill the task `wscript.exe` under the taskmanager.

## Why F16, and why not F15?
* I love fighter aircrafts, and I wanted to name my script after the `General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon`. Here's the wikipedia link for more reading. :) 
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon
* The other reason is that F16 was the keyboard key that never existed, and is now useful as a phantom key for our purpose. Awesome!
